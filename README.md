# Echo server

Small utility server in express.js. The main purpose is to run `POST` or `PUT` stuff to this server, and it will echo it to the standard output. To modify its behaviour, simply define new routes and actions, associate them to a `Profile`, and run `node index.js`.

## TODO
- [ ] Allow using an OpenAPI definition to define a profile
